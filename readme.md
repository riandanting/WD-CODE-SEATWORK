  In the world of Shinkai, Arkana is one of the most sought after energies. It can power an entire city and give miracles to anyone with the
  guts to touch it. Because of this, the Abyss is always trying to get their hands on this precious energy. This piqued the interest of multiversal
  entities seeking to keep the Arkana to themselves
